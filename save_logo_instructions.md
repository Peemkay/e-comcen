# Nigerian Army Signals Logo Implementation Instructions

Follow these steps to implement the Nigerian Army Signals logo in your NASDS application:

## Step 1: Save the Logo Files

1. Save the Nigerian Army Signals logo image to:
   ```
   C:\Users\chaki\Documents\Projects Augment\NASDS\assets\images\nas_logo.png
   ```

2. Save the same image as the icon:
   ```
   C:\Users\chaki\Documents\Projects Augment\NASDS\assets\images\nas_icon.png
   ```

## Step 2: Generate App Icons

Run the following command in PowerShell (not bash):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\chaki\Documents\Projects Augment\NASDS"
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

## Step 3: Test the Implementation

Run the application to see the new logo in action:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\chaki\Documents\Projects Augment\NASDS"
flutter run -d windows
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "NoDecoderForImageFormatException" error, it means the image format is not recognized. Make sure:

1. The image is a valid PNG file
2. The image is not corrupted
3. Try converting the image to PNG format using an image editor

## Manual Implementation

If the automatic icon generation doesn't work, you can still use the logo in the app:

1. Make sure the logo files are saved in the correct locations
2. The app will use the logo through the LogoUtil class and PlaceholderLogo widget
3. You may need to manually create icons for different platforms

## Additional Notes

- The logo implementation has been configured to use the exact logo as provided without any recreation, animation, or filtering
- The logo will be displayed consistently throughout the application
- All necessary code changes have already been made to use the logo
